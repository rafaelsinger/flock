Typography

Whitespace: Generous use of whitespace between elements.

Component Behavior: Prioritize smoothness, subtle transitions over sharp animations.

‚úçÔ∏è Tone & Microcopy Guidelines
Voice
Friendly, warm, approachable, youthful ‚Äî like a helpful peer, not a formal institution.

Slightly playful but always respectful and clear.

Phrasing
Prefer positive, action-driven language:

"Stay connected, wherever you go."

Avoid heavy corporate jargon or overly technical language.

Emoji Usage
Light, friendly emoji use is encouraged ‚Äî one emoji max per screen or section.

Emoji examples: ü¶© (flamingo), üéì (graduation cap), üåé (world)

üñ• UI/UX Best Practices
General UX
Onboarding: Step-by-step progressive disclosure; no overwhelming forms.

Feedback: Always provide confirmation when a user submits a form or takes an action.

Empty States: Encourage users positively when lists/directories are empty (e.g., "No flock yet ‚Äî be the first to land here!").

Form Design
Small Steps: Break large forms into bite-sized steps (no more than 3‚Äì4 inputs per step).

Smart Defaults: Default country to "United States," hide unnecessary fields unless needed (e.g., Borough field only if City = NYC).

Clear Error Messages: Friendly, actionable, and non-blaming ("Oops! Looks like you missed your city name.").

Directory Design
Search bar and filters must be easy to find and persistently accessible.

User cards should:

Prioritize Name, City, Company/School, Role/Program.

Show a small visual difference if the user is "working" vs "in school."

Component Design
Atomic Design Approach: Build small, reusable components: Buttons, Inputs, Cards, ProfileCards, etc.

Naming Conventions: Use clear, descriptive, PascalCase names for components.
Examples: PostgradTypeSelector, UserCard, VisibilityOptionsForm

Responsiveness:
Must work cleanly across mobile, tablet, desktop. Use mobile-first design principles.

Styling:
Prefer TailwindCSS style utility classes. All colors must be sourced from the brand palette ‚Äî no ad-hoc random hex colors.

Overall Project Philosophy:
Delightfully simple. Every interaction should feel lightweight, easy, and satisfying.Minimalist but alive. Friendly, human, colorful ‚Äî but never noisy. Focus on user momentum. Remove obstacles, encourage quick engagement, and make discovery feel exciting. When in doubt, simplify
